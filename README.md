Framework suggestion: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)/[Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

## Prior Art

[Parking Heaven](https://parkingheaven.com/) is an iOS/Android app that does something similar. 

## Planned features

- [ ] Scheduled/planned spot opening
- [ ] Indicate time since spot open
    - [ ] Shade from green to red as time goes on? E.g. 1 sec after it's green, 5 minutes later it's red, to indicate likelihood it's still open
